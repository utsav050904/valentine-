                    It‚Äôs incredible to think how just a few days ago, I didn‚Äôt even know
                    who you were. Meeting you through instagram was a chance I‚Äôm
                    forever grateful for. In the beginning, I wasn‚Äôt sure how we would
                    connect, how we‚Äôd talk, or how you‚Äôd be. But now, after just a short
                    time of talking, I‚Äôve come to realize something‚Äîyou're absolutely
                    amazing.

                    There‚Äôs this charm, a beauty that‚Äôs hard to describe. From the
                    sparkle in your eyes to the warmth in your smile, everything about
                    you seems flawless.

                    I have never done these things like writing a letter or making something for a girl before. I have
                    never believed in valentines day. I used to think these were quite immature things. But since I met
                    you, I can't help but want to celebrate it with you.

                    Talking to you has quickly become one of my favorite parts of the
                    day. Every time I see a message from you, I can't help but smile. It
                    feels like my day instantly gets brighter just because of our
                    conversation. You're not just great to look at; your personality
                    makes you even more special.
